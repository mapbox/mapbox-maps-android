/**
 * This is the main entry point for controlling the Mapbox car map surface.
 *
 * You can add the [MapboxCarMap] to your entire [androidx.car.app.Session] using the [Lifecycle].
 * And then any [androidx.car.app.Screen] that is using a supported template will automatically
 * show the Mapbox map. You can also, specify a [MapboxCarMap] for each individual
 * [androidx.car.app.Screen] by constructing the [MapboxCarMap] with the screen Lifecycle.
 *
 * Supported templates include:
 *  - [androidx.car.app.navigation.model.NavigationTemplate]
 *  - [androidx.car.app.navigation.model.RoutePreviewNavigationTemplate]
 *  - [androidx.car.app.navigation.model.PlaceListNavigationTemplate]
 *
 * Customize your [MapboxCarMap] with your own implementations of [MapboxCarMapObserver].
 * Use the [registerObserver] and [unregisterObserver] functions to load and detach the observers.
 *
 * The internals of this class use [AppManager.setSurfaceCallback], which assumes there is a single
 * surface callback. Do not use setSurfaceCallback, and do not create multiple instances of
 * [MapboxCarMap].
 *
 * @since 1.0.0
