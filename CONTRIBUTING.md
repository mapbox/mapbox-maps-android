### Github issue labels

Our labeling system is:

 * **minimalistic:** Labels’ usefulness are inversely proportional to how many we have.
 * **objective:** Labels should be objective enough that any two people would agree on a labeling decision.
 * **useful:** Labels should track state or capture semantic meaning that would otherwise be hard to search for.
